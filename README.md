Actionable insights:

  The engineering teams of f1 races could use this telemetry dashboard to improve the settings of their cars.
  
  Establish new strategies and settings for the next sessions and hence improve the fastest lap time.
  
  (From Verstappen's perspective) The engineering team needs to investigate the root cause of slower gear shift and whether it might be decisive for the average car’s
  performance, while taking advantage of the less stiff driving experience (compared to McLaren’s) through corners and turns that allows greater average speeds.
